# Code Sample Repository

This repository contains my code sample. The purpose of the code sample is to predict the chess game win rate of white side from the board composition. (Code_sample.ipynb)[https://github.com/beilrz/code_sample/blob/main/code_sample.ipynb] is the shorter version of my code sample, which includes the code for data cleaning, prediction through polynomial regression, and prediction through a large language model, with 198 lines of code in total. code_sample_full_length.ipynb is the full-length sample, with additional exploratory data analysis and error analysis.
